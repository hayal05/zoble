# hooks below (which run as early as the app's first DB connection, i.e.
# during startup) try to call eventlet.tpool.execute(...).
# ^ MUST be the very first thing that happens in this module, before any other
# import (including stdlib ones like os/logging). gunicorn is configured to run
# this app with the eventlet worker (`gunicorn -k eventlet`, see Procfile), which
# means every request — HTTP and WebSocket alike — is served through eventlet's
# cooperative green threads. If the stdlib socket/ssl/threading/time modules
# aren't patched before anything else imports them, blocking calls (SQLite
# writes via SQLAlchemy, DNS lookups, etc.) can stall the single worker's event
# loop instead of yielding, which is what was causing registration/login to hang
# or reset in production and surface as a generic "Connection error" — this bug
# affects plain HTTP routes too, not just Socket.IO traffic, because they all
# run through the same eventlet-patched worker.

# Turso/libsql runs its network I/O through a compiled (Rust) extension,
# not Python's socket module — eventlet.monkey_patch() at the top of this
# file has no visibility into it, so every DB call would otherwise block
# this process's single eventlet worker outright (freezing every other
# request and Socket.IO heartbeat until the call returns). Same problem,
# same fix as validate_uploaded_image()'s Pillow call above: push the
# blocking work onto real OS threads so the event loop stays free while
# it runs.
#
# IMPORTANT: unlike the Pillow call, this can't just be
# eventlet.tpool.execute(...) per call. SQLite-family connections
# (libsql included) are thread-affine — a connection opened on one OS
# thread generally can't safely be used from a different one, and
# eventlet.tpool's shared pool hands each call to whichever worker
# thread is free, with no guarantee it's the same thread twice. Opening
# the connection on one tpool thread and then running a query on
# another is a good way to get a silent hang rather than a clean error.
#
# So instead: give every connection its own dedicated single-thread
# executor at connect time, and route every operation on that
# connection through that same thread for its whole lifetime. We still
# use eventlet.tpool.execute() — but only to cooperatively wait on the
# dedicated thread's result, never to run the DB call itself on an
# arbitrary shared-pool thread.
#
# Hooked at the SQLAlchemy Engine class level (not a specific engine)
# so it covers every cursor execution and every new DBAPI connection —
# both the Turso/libsql path and the local-SQLite fallback — without
# having to touch the ~200 call sites that use db.session elsewhere in
